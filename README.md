# Anfield Lane

The Anfield Lane website is a simple website for casual football fans who are looking for short consumable items of trivia regarding Anfield, the iconic stadium of Liverpool Football Club.

Anfield Lane provides football fans, particularly of Liverpool FC with an easily accessible landing page that displays instant information about the club and stadium on that day through history.

The website offers an engaging color scheme and simple layout, thus enabling users of all ages to yield valuable information.

Rather than overwhelm site visitors with an  overabundance of information, the design seeks to merely attract sufficient interest to convince the end user to sign up for more detailed blog posts on the history of the club and stadium.

# Features

**Navigation**
 - Within the uppermost component of the page, the navigation section begins by displaying the site name, Anfield Lane that links to the top of the home page.
 - Laterally opposite the site name, toward the right hand side are the remaining navigation links, namely: On This Day, Sign Up and Resources which link to different sections of the same page.
- The navigation menu headings are displayed in Roboto font in contrast to that of the main logo font which is displayed in Playfair Display. This is by design, with the intention being to showcase a contrast between old and new at the very top of the page - thus reflecting the theme of the rest of the website to follow.
 is in a font that looks like code, and a color that contrasts with the background.
 - The website name and logo, Anfield Lane was chosen to incorporate the word 'lane' with a view to partially resembling the phrase 'memory lane' - again attempting to add subtle nods to the importance of the past as well as the present day.

**The Header**
- The color scheme chosen for the font of the logo text and navigation list items was dark against a white background with priority being given to accessibility and a simple,clearly visible and coherent first impression of the website

**The Main Image**
- The main image aliased as 'main-outer' in the underlying code displays a vibrant landscape shot of the Anfield Stadium using a zoom out illusion achieved by reversing a similar but opposite keyframe effect used in the **Love Running Project.**
 The purpose of this is to offer a strong follow up to a very simple header layout whilst capturing the viewers attention and delivering the mission statement of the website simultaneously.

.
 - This section clearly states that the website delivers key facts about the stadium on that day throughout history.

**The On This Day Section**
- The On This Day section provides users with daily key events in Anfield stadium history.
 - This is the only section aside from the main image above that incorporates imagery. In order to avoid diluting the impact of the main image, the choice was made to edit the opacity of the imported image so as to appear as a more subtle watermark as opposed to a louder, noisier center-piece image.

-  The Sign Up section encourages the user to input their contact details in order to enable them to receive updates on historic stadium milestones and upcoming fan events so they can remain informed at regular intervals.
 - The form collects the user's first and last name as well as their email address.
 -  Each field requires an input before being able to successfully sign up. Additionally the email field requires the appropriate characteristics of a legitimate email address before the sign me up button will capture their contact information.

# Testing

- I tested and can confirm that this page works in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
- I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar in Chrome.
- I confirmed that the navigation, header, On This Day, Sign Up and Resources text are all readable and easy to understand.
- I have confirmed that the form works: requires entries in every field, will only accept an email in the email field and then the submit button works.

***Bugs***

*Solved Bugs*

- The main issues encountered throughout this project were in the form of the positioning of accompanying images.
- The difficulties arose when trying to add images on either side of the Sign Up and Resources section, whereby responsiveness became an issue for smaller devices in that under narrower screen lengths it required the user to scroll for longer before arriving at the next meaningful section, thus leading to a more cumbersome user experience.
 It's important to state that this was less a bug and more of a decision made to remove them in the name of simplicity and accessibility so as to reduce any potentially unnecessary noise.

**Validator Testing**

*HTML*
 - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator

*CSS*
- Only the following error remains in
 "Imported style sheets are not checked in direct input and file upload modes"
 I can confirm that there is no observable negative impact on the styling of the website as a result of this error message.

*Accessibility*
 - I confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by running it through lighthouse in devtools
